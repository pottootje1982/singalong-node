The weather outside is frightful\nBut the fire is so delightful\nAnd since we've no place to go,\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\n\nIt doesn't show signs of stopping\nSo I brought some corn for popping;\nThe lights are turned 'way down low.\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow! When we finally kiss good-night,\nHow I hate going out in the storm!\nBut if you really hold me tight\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\nThe fire is slowly dying\nAnd, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing,\nBut as long as you love me so,\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\n\nSilver and gold\nSilver and gold\nEv'ryone wishes for silver and gold\nHow do you measure it's worth?\nJust by the pleasure it gives here on earth\n\nSilver and gold\nSilver and gold\nMean so much more when I see\nSilver and gold decorations\nOn ev'ry Christmas tree",

    "lyrics": "Vrienden zoeken is een vak apart, Je vind ze maar niet zo.\nZe zijn heel schaars en goed verstopt, je krijgt ze niet cadeau.\nWanneer je geld op zak hebt, dan zwermen ze om je heen.Maar dat zijn niet de vrienden die je zoekt.\nEen echte vriend die vind je pas, wanneer je zelf niet lacht.\nDie sleept jou door het donker van de nacht, tot je weer lacht.\nEen echte vriend is pas een vriend,\nook als ie niks aan je verdient,\nen toch je vriend wil zijn je hele leven lang.\nEen echte vriend maakt het niet uit,\nal heb je zelfs geen rooie duit\nHij is en blijft een echte vriend,\neen echte vriend.\nIk weet het wel het valt niet mee, alleen zijn is geen pret\nJe zoekt naar wat genegenheid, naar warmte in je bed.\nMaar meestal is het zo als het gaat, gespeelde vriendlijkheid\nZe gaan er snel vandoor bij narigheid.\n\nEen echte vriend is pas een vriend,\nook als ie niks aan je verdient,\nen toch je vriend wil zijn je hele leven lang.\nEen echte vriend maakt het niet uit,\nal heb je zelfs geen rooie duit,\nhij is en blijft een echte vriend,\neen echte vriend.\nHij is en blijft een echte vriend, een echte vriend.\nEn als je hem gevonden hebt, als vriend aan je gebonden hebt\nDan zie je door het bos de bomen weer.\nEen echte vriend je leven lang, hij komt vaak onverwacht.\nEn sleept je door het donker tot je lacht, een echte vriend.\nEen echte vriend is pas een vriend,\nook als ie niks aan je verdient,\nen toch je vriend wil zijn je hele leven lang.\nEen echte vriend maakt het niet uit,\nal heb je zelfs geen rooie duit,\nhij is en blijft een echte vriend,\neen echte vriend.",

And so is their city. This is a very personal song, so if the viewer cannot understand it, particularly those of you who are European residents, save up all your bread, and fly Trans-Love Airways to San Francisco, USA. Then, maybe, you’ll understand the song. It will be worth it, if not for the sake of this song, but for the sake of your own piece of mind\n\nStrobe light beam, creates dreams\nWalls move, minds do too\nOn a warm San Franciscan night\n\nOld child , young child\nFeel all right\n\nOn a warm San Franciscan night\nAngels sing, leather wings\nJeans of blue, Harley Davidson's too\nOn a warm San Franciscan night\n\nOld angel, young angel\nFeel all right\nOn a warm San Franciscan night\n\nI wasn't born there\nPerhaps I'll die there\nThere's no place left to go\nSan Francisco\n\nCops face is filled with hate\nHeavens above\nHe's on a street called \"Love\"\nWhen will they ever learn?\nOld cop, young cop\nFeel all right\nOn a warm San Franciscan night\n\nThe children are cool\nThey don't raise fools\nIt's an American dream\nIncludes Indians too",

So out the door we go.\nBack to the ride with Steve inside and alive; off we drive\nI hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll\nNever get far, riding around in a stolen\nPolice car, so we dropped it off and\nPiled in a Caddy; Steve was driving\nBecause I had to talk to my man about something.\n\n- Look, I don't know anything about any fucking set-up, you can torture me all you want.\n- Torture you, that's good, that's a good idea, I like that one.\n\nRunning around robbing banks\nAll wacked off of Scooby Snacks!

They gave chase, but my man\nSteve is an ace; we lost those brothers\nWith haste. We cast off and along we went\nOff Bermuda to an island resort we rented.\n\n- Sonny, I need you cool, are you cool?\n- I am cool.\n\nRunning around robbing banks\nAll wacked off of Scooby Snacks!

How much longer?\n\nThey say a city in the desert lies\nThe vanity of an ancient king\nBut the city lies in broken pieces\nWhere the wind howls and the vultures sing\nThese are the works of man\nThis is the sun of our ambition\nIt would make a prison of my life\nIf you become another's wife\nWith every prison blown to dust\nMy enemies walk free\nI'm mad about you I'm mad about you\n\nAnd I have never in my life\nFelt more alone than I do now\nAlthough I claim dominations over all I see\nIt means nothing to me\nThere are no victories\nIn all our histories, without love\n\nA stone's throw from Jerusalem\nA walked a lonely mile in the moonlight\nAnd though a million stars were shining\nMy heart was lost on a distant planet\nThat whirls around the April moon\nWhirling in an arc of sadness\nI'm lost without you I'm lost without you\nAnd though you hold the keys to ruin\nOf everything I see\nWith every prison blown to dust,\nMy enemies walk free\nThough all the kingdoms turn to sand\nAnd fall into the sea\nI'm mad about you I'm mad about you",

Oh!\n(I shot the sheriff.) - the sheriff.\n(But I swear it was in selfdefence.)\nOh, no! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!\nI say: I shot the sheriff - Oh, Lord! -\n(And they say it is a capital offence.)\nYeah! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!\n\nSheriff John Brown always hated me,\nFor what, I don't know:\nEvery time I plant a seed,\nHe said kill it before it grow -\nHe said kill them before they grow.\nAnd so:\n\nRead it in the news:\n(I shot the sheriff.) Oh, Lord!\n\n(But I swear it was in self-defence.)\nWhere was the deputy? (Oo-oo-oh)\nI say: I shot the sheriff,\nBut I swear it was in selfdefence. (Oo-oh) Yeah!\n\nFreedom came my way one day\nAnd I started out of town, yeah!\nAll of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown\nAiming to shoot me down,\nSo I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:\nIf I am guilty I will pay.\n\n(I shot the sheriff,)\nBut I say (But I didn't shoot no deputy),\nI didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh), oh no!\n(I shot the sheriff.) I did!\nBut I didn't shoot no deputy. Oh! (Oo-oo-ooh)\n\nReflexes had got the better of me\nAnd what is to be must be:\nEvery day the bucket a-go a well,\nOne day the bottom a-go drop out,\nOne day the bottom a-go drop out.\nI say:\n\nI - I - I - I shot the sheriff.\nLord, I didn't shot the deputy. Yeah!\nI - I (shot the sheriff) -\nBut I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah! No, yeah!",

To sit and watch you stare at your feet?\nWhat was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?\n\nI feel no need to forgive but I might as well\nBut let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt\nPay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down\nWalk for hours in the dark feeling all hell\n\nDon't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best\nYou don't deserve what you don't respect\nDon't deserve what you say you love and then neglect\n\nNow bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young\nTake back what you said\nCan't lose what you never had\n\nI feel no need to forgive but I might as well\nBut let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt\nPay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down\nWalk for hours in the dark feeling all hell\n\nYou got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift\nAnd I'll never see you again if I can help it\nIn five years I hope the songs feel like covers\nDedicated to new lovers\n\nYou got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift\nAnd I'll never see you again if I can help it\nIn five years I hope the songs feel like covers\nDedicated to new lovers\n\nYou got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift\nAnd I'll never see you again if I can help it\nIn five years I hope the songs feel like covers\nDedicated to new lovers",

Wat een oogst!\nMet olie laten zij hun huid weer glanzen.\nDe bomen bloeien en de vogels dansen.\nHoog in de toppen woont de ooievaar.\nDe steenbok weet in rotsen weg te kruipen\nEn in de kloven kan de klipdas schuilen.\n\nU schiep de maan, die de getijden weet.\nDe zon gaat op, de zon gaat ook weer onder.\nAls u het donker roept, dan valt de nacht,\nDan gaan de dieren in het bos op jacht.\nDe jonge leeuwen lopen prooi te zoeken,\nZe brullen luid en vragen u om voedsel.\nDan gaat de zon weer op, de dag begint.\nZij kruipen in hun holen om te slapen.\nDan sta ik op en werk tot aan de avond.\n\nHEER, wat heeft u veel gemaakt, veelkleurig en veelzijdig,\nEn al uw werken spreken van uw wijsheid,\nZo onvoorstelbaar veel heeft u gemaakt op aarde.\n\nEn dan de zee, zo onafzienbaar wijd,\nWaar het krioelt van dieren, niet te tellen –\nDe schepen varen op die grote zee,\nTerwijl u met de leviatan speelt.\nEn alle dieren hebben voedsel nodig,\nZij eten uit uw hand als u die opent.\nNeemt u hun adem weg, dan sterven zij.\nU maakt het leven en geeft alles adem,\nU geeft een nieuw gezicht aan heel de aarde.\n\nVoor alle tijden alle eer aan God;\nDat hij plezier mag vinden in zijn schepping.\nAls hij de aarde aankijkt, beeft ze al,\nAls hij de bergen aanraakt, rookt het al.\nIk zing mijn leven lang om God te eren.\nIk hoop dat hij mijn woorden zal waarderen,\nWant bij de HEER kan ik gelukkig zijn.\nHet kwaad vergaat, de aarde wordt gereinigd.\nJa, alle eer aan God, ik blijf hem prijzen.\n\nHEER, wat heeft u veel gemaakt, veelkleurig en veelzijdig,\nEn al uw werken spreken van uw wijsheid,\nZo onvoorstelbaar veel heeft u gemaakt op aarde.\n\nIk wil u noemen bij uw naam, HEER God.",
