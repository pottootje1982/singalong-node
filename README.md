## Bugs

- enable switching playlist switching when monitor mode is on (then you can also enable monitoring on startup)
- Cannot start selected song mobile
- cancel getting tracks when switching playlists
- Playlist autocomplete hiding mobile
- close databases after use in node
- show also custom playlists in autocomplete

## Improvements

- introduce spotify [player sdk](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/)
- don't autofocus track in mobile mode
- show devices in lyrics menu
- get playlists without lyrics first to improve responsiveness
- consider using material ui Alert for exception coming from server
- virtualization playlist? tried react-window, doesn't work nicely
