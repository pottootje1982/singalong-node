# Singalongify

## Bugs
- playlists autocomplete missing

## Improvements

- show playlists quicker by using spotifyAxios
- consider using material ui Alert for exception coming from server

## Features

- sorting of playlist
- Different radio stations (and configure which show up for a user)

- lagging performance when playing tracks
- when in other playlist, enabling 'monitor currently playing track' does jump to correct playlist, but then fails to jump to correct track (also 'monitor currently playing track' is automatically deselected).
- two tracks are selected in case there are double occurrences in playlist. Check e.g. David Bowie - Starman in singalong.m3u
